# Wildfire_Detection_using_python

As part of my data science project using machine learning at Bhavan's Vivekananda College, I developed a Python-based wildfire detection system to address the critical need for early wildfire identification, leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques. The project utilizes public datasets like the Kaggle Wildfire Detection Dataset and forestfire_edited.csv, employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based detection and a Random Forest Classifier (88.18% accuracy) for environmental data analysis, with features like temperature, humidity, and Fire Weather Index components. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, the system achieves real-time detection capabilities, visualized via scatter plots and performance metrics like MSE and R². All project files, including code, and documentation, are available on GitHub, demonstrating my ability to build robust models for environmental protection and disaster management.
